Problem Statements:
1.The partitioning of a system into collaborating classes raises the problem of maintaining consistency among them. The problem is how to maintain consistency in a situation where one or more of the following scenarios hold:
	-An abstraction has two aspects, one dependent on the other; encapsulating them separately allows to extend and reuse them.
	-Changing one object requires changing others, but it is not clear in advance how many and which ones.
	-An object should be able to notify others, without knowing in advance which ones they are.
When exam section make changes in their database the notification should send to its dependents.

2.The complexcity of system is more wehen user wish to access library functionality.like for library registratin he/she has to go to department then library and then librarian.
again when user want to get books have to follow the same procedure.

3.there is scenario where user wants access e-learning facility.where after getting perticular type of lecture he/she might wants some other tye of lecture so repeated objects get created here.
